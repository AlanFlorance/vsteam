SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides access to your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team 
    Foundation Server (TFS) from Mac, Linux and PC.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Add an account using Add-VSTeamAccount and then you can call the rest of the 
    functions.

    Use Set-VSTeamDefaultProject so you do not have to provide the -ProjectName 
    parameter with the rest of the calls in the module. However, the 
    -ProjectName parameter is dynamic and you can use tab completion to cycle
    through all the projects.

    Using the $VSTeamVersionTable varible you can control which version of the APIs are used.
    
    PS C:\> $VSTeamVersionTable

    Name             Value
    ----             -----
    Account          https://test.visualstudio.com
    Build            2.0
    DefaultProject
    Core             1.0
    Release          3.0-preview.1
    Git              1.0
    DistributedTask  3.0-preview.1

    To use different API versions you can update the version in the version table.

    PS C:\> $VSTeamVersionTable.Build = '4.0'

EXAMPLES
    Get-VSTeamProject

    This will return all the WellFormed team projects.

    Get-VSTeamProject | Remove-VSTeamProject -Force

    This will delete all the projects in your VSTS for TFS. Use with caution.
