TOPIC
    VSTeam Profiles

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Profiles allow you to store account information so you do not have to 
    remember your Personal Access Token (PAT). Simply create a profile for
    the desired account and use the profile name to switch to that account
    using the Add-VSTeamAccount function. 

LONG DESCRIPTION
   Using profiles makes it easier to switch from one account to another. 
   Profiles store the URL to the account and authentication information.

EXAMPLES
    Add-VSTeamProfile -Account demonstrations -Name demonstrations -PersonalAccessToken 7a8ilh6db4aforlrnrqmdrxdztkjvcc4uhlh5vgbmgap3mziwnga

    This will add a profile named demonstrations for use with Add-VSTeamAccount.

    Get-VSTeamProfiles | Remove-VSTeamProfiles -Force

    This will delete all the profiles.
